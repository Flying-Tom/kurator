## Inactive members

_Members are continuously active contributors in the community._

A core principle in maintaining a healthy community is encouraging active
participation. It is inevitable that people's focuses will change over time and
they are not expected to be actively contributing forever.

Therefore members with an extended period away from the project with no activity
will emeritus or be removed from the Kurator GitHub Organizations and will be required to go through the org membership process again after re-familiarizing themselves with the current state.

### How inactivity is measured

Inactive members are defined as members of one of the Kurator Organizations
with **no** contributions across any organization within 12 months.

After an extended period away from the project with no activity
those members would need to re-familiarize themselves with the current state
before being able to contribute effectively.
